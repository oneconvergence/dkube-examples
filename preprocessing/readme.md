# Insurance Cost Prediction Example (with Preprocessing)
 
This example trains a model to predict the cost of insurance based on a set of input characteristics for an individual.  This description provides a step-by-step recipe for using the example.  More details for the platform are available at [DKube User Guide](https://www.dkube.io/guide/guide3_x/Getting_Started.html).

This example includes a preprocessing step that creates a new version of the Dataset before training.  This is executed from a Kubeflow Pipeline.  A more complete example that does not use proprocessing is available at [Insurance Example](../insurance/readme.md).

> **Note** In the example, use only lower-case characters in the names that you create. Hyphens are acceptable in any position **other than** the first and last characters, but no other special characters should be used.

> **Note** You can choose the names for your resources in most cases.  It is recommended that you choose names that are unique to your workflow even if you are organizing them by Project.  This will ensure that there is a system-wide organization for the names, and that you can easily filter based on your own work.  A sensible approach might be to have it be something like **\<example-name\>-\<your-initials\>-\<resource-type\>**.  But this is simply a recommendation.  The specific names will be up to you.

## 1. Resource Setup

 In order to use the scripts to create runs, models, pipelines, etc some setup needs to be done.  This section explains the setup that is necessary for any of the example sections.

### Create Code Repo
 A Model is created by running the Training Code on a Dataset.  This section explains how to create a Code repo.  The Dataset is contained within the execution code.
 
  > **Note** In the example, use only lower-case characters in the names that you create. Hyphens are acceptable in any position **other than** the first or last characters, but no other special characters should be used.

 - Navigate to the `Code` menu on the left

## 6. Inference WebApp
 A model that is running on a production server takes live data and provides an output prediction based on the model training.  A custom application is written to interpret how the model interacts with the live data.  One Convergence has written a web-based inference application for this example.  It is meant to show how this particular example could be used.

 - The WebApp needs to be installed on your local machine
 - In order to install the WebApp, the following command is run once on your machine:
   - `docker run -p 8501:8501 ocdr/streamlit-webapp:insurance-tf`
 - In order to use the WebApp, use the network url that is specified
   - If this does not bring up the WebApp UI, use the following url:
     - http://localhost:8501 <br><br>
 - Fill in the required fields a follows:
   - DKube serving url: `URL of the server running DKube`
     - This is the endpoint url from a running deployment, available from the "Deployments" menu under the "Endpoint" column
   - DKube user auth token: `Authorization token`, available from the Developer Settings menu
   - Select the characteristics of the individual
   - Select `Predict`
